        "I'm a software developer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I enjoy creating fun things using computer science technologies. I started to gain interests in web development since 2019 when I built my first web app: a simple online project management tool for myself. I was fascinated by how efficient and straightforward turning ideas into real applications can be in this area.",
        "Till today, I have built both static and dynamic websites as well as server-side apps for customers including, but no limited to a local restaurant, an e-commerce business owner and a media company.",
        "I'm continously expanding my skillsets and ready to deliver better products which hopefully can make people's life easier in certain ways."
